## triangles

The identifiers should be put in alphabetical order ex. a then b, they should also be put side lengths first then angles ex. a then A

Hehe idk how to implement it otherwise D:

The individual scripts for right-angled triangles are now deprecated as I have moved them into right_triangle_calculator.py
